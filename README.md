# Introduction:
In today's data-driven business environment, companies strive to leverage analytical insights to improve operational efficiency and drive financial growth. The Tasty Bytes website, a popular platform for sharing and discovering recipes, generates a significant amount of user-generated data. To enhance user engagement and increase website traffic, it is imperative to understand how users interact with the site's content.

### Problem Statement:
Despite the availability of rich user interaction data, Tasty Bytes lacks a clear understanding of which specific factors drive user engagement and contribute to increased website traffic. This lack of insight hinders the ability to optimise content strategy and improve user retention.

### Objective:
The main goal of this project is to utilize data science methods to examine data from the Tasty Bytes website. Our aim is to spot key patterns in user interactions and pinpoint the most favored recipes. This will help us generate practical insights to enhance content and create a predictive model that can accurately identify high-traffic recipes with at least an 80% success rate.

### Data Sources:

For this endeavour, we will extract data directly from the Tasty Bytes website. The dataset encompasses a variety of metrics, including recipe details, nutritional content (calories, carbohydrates, sugar, protein), culinary category, number of servings, and the high-traffic designation for each recipe.

This project is also a component of the certification process for the Datacamp Professional Certification Examination.
* [Data Camp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn)

### Summary :
The logistic regression and random forest models showed promising results, with precision scores of 0.82 and ROC AUC of 0.83, indicating they are capable of predicting high-traffic recipes with high accuracy. This aligns well with the businessâ€™s goal of achieving at least 80% accuracy in predictions.
